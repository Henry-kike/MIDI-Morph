I'm looking to combine the best of sequencers like keystep pro and op-1. I make animations for the diferent mode of my sequencer (inspired in the op-1) and i work on adding two track (like keystep pro). The sequencer can save and play chords sequences and i want to add song mode which could play a sequence in different starting notes. Then i will work on playing two sequence simultaneusly, firts on two different MIDI chanels and later in two phisycal MIDI ports.
